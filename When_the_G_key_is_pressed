Key activation: When the user presses the "G" key on the keyboard, it sends an electrical signal to the computer, indicating that the user wants to input the "G" character.

Keycode generation: The computer's hardware translates the electrical signal into a binary code that represents the "G" key.

Operating system recognition: The computer's operating system receives the binary code and recognizes it as the "G" character. Depending on the keyboard layout and other settings, the operating system may generate a different character instead.

Application input: If there's a text field or document open, the "G" character is inserted where the cursor is, allowing the user to input the "G" character.

Application-specific actions: In some applications or software, the "G" key may be mapped to a specific action or function, such as throwing a grenade in a video game. This depends on how the application or software is configured.
